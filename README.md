## 👀 Previewing Changes (Staging)

All changes go to the `staging` branch first. Netlify builds that branch at one fixed preview address:

**https://staging--curious-profiterole-fae7e1.netlify.app**

1. Commit changes to `staging` (or merge work branches into `staging`).
2. Review them at the staging address. Every update to `staging` rebuilds the same link.
3. When approved, merge `staging` into `main`. That publishes the change to thewrkshop.com.

Netlify deploy previews for pull requests are turned off, so the staging address is the only preview link.

## 📥 Adding Content

Both **Daily Devotionals** and **Weekly Blogs** are stored as JSON in the `content/` folder.  
The build scripts use these files to generate static HTML + JSON archives automatically.

### 🗓️ Daily Devotionals

- **File path:**  
  `content/daily/<SCRIPTURE-SLUG>_<TITLE-SLUG>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`

  > Example:  
  `content/daily/Psalm-119-37_scroll-or-soul_2025-09-22.json`

- **Slug rules:**  
  - Base on **scripture reference** + **title** + **date**  
  - Replace apostrophes (e.g., `doesn't → doesnt`)  
  - Replace spaces and non-alphanumeric characters with `-`  

- **Body format:**

```json
{
  "date": "2025-09-22",
  "title": "Scroll or Soul?",
  "verse_ref": "Psalm 119:37",
  "verse_text": "Turn my eyes from worthless things; preserve my life according to your word.",
  "insight": [
    "Our world fights for attention, and every scroll shapes your soul. Psalm 119:37 calls us to guard our eyes from worthless things that steal time and peace.",
    "Every scroll is a seed. What you watch, read, and consume takes root. Over time, it grows into confidence or chaos. Don’t trade depth with God for endless digital distraction."
  ],
  "one_minute_win": "Replace one 5-minute scroll break with one 5-minute Scripture break.",
  "declaration": "My soul deserves better than endless scrolls."
}
```
#### Visual progressions ("flow" blocks)

Any section of a daily can include a progression drawn as a visual (on the page and in the email):

```json
{
  "type": "flow",
  "title": "Optional small label",
  "steps": [
    "Disagreement.",
    { "label": "Shame interprets it.", "note": "“If they know, they’ll think less of me.”" },
    "Escalation."
  ],
  "loop": "Optional line shown with ↻",
  "caption": "Optional line under the visual."
}
```

Steps go top to bottom, getting darker, and the last step is highlighted. Use it for real sequences (cause → effect), not for every list.

### ✍️ Weekly Blogs

- **File path:**  
  `content/blog/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<TITLE-SLUG>.json`

  > Example:  
  `content/blog/2025-08-30_renewed-why-god-doesnt-move-at-your-pace.json`

- **Slug rules:**  
  - Based on **date** + **title**  
  - Lowercase, spaces → `-`  
  - Remove apostrophes (`doesn't → doesnt`)  
  - Strip other non-alphanumeric characters  

- **Body format:**

```json

  "date": "2025-08-30",
  "title": "RENEWED: Why God Doesn’t Move at Your Pace",
