    "Our world fights for attention, and every scroll shapes your soul. Psalm 119:37 calls us to guard our eyes from worthless things that steal time and peace.",
    "Every scroll is a seed. What you watch, read, and consume takes root. Over time, it grows into confidence or chaos. Donâ€™t trade depth with God for endless digital distraction."
